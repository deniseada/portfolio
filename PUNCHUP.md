# Portfolio Punch Up - Smiski Unboxing

**Overview**
This project will be an interactive digital smiski unboxing website. It has been a trend recently to open these toy blindboxes without knowing what's inside them creating a fun, exciting, and suspenseful experience, hence the name "blindbox".
This project will simulate the same experience but digital. It will animate a similar expeirence to give a familar dopamine hit as it would in real life.

**Wireframes Example:**

**What am I actually building?**
I want to build a digital unboxing experience with the following:

- Landing page that will visually be inspired by the smiski brand.
- A interactive virtual blindbox simulation where users are able to click and choose which box they want to open.
- An animated unboxing experience where it maybe shakes or shows the motion of unboxing the box.
- Randomized smiski reveal based on rarity of each tiers.
- A collection tracker to indicate how many times the users have opened the same figure.
- Sound effects to maximize the user experience
- Maybe some sort of game to enable more excitement and wariness of choosing a box. (based on a points system.)

Overall, the goal is to simulate the exact experince as users would in real life when opening a blindbox.

**Why this enhances my portfolio?**
First of all, I think this shows a lot abot my personality and what I enjoy. It's always a fun experince for me opening up and not knowing the chances to pulling the figurines that I want.

This also demonstrates interactive UI design, as well as Animations, Randomization logic and I will be also building my own components / designing them on Adobe Illustrator.

Not only does this reflect my personal interests, but also provides a playful interactive user experience that is authetic and aligns with my creative direction.

**Resources**

- I would be referencing the charcter and overall concept of the brand.
- illustrator to design box and most graphics in the web page.

**Fears and Doubts**

- I think It might be time constraining, I would need to manage my time well in order to achieve something that I would be satisfied with.
- Not quiet sure if it's portfolio-level project rather than just a fun side quest.
- Not getting the experience/enjoyment I wanted to achieve in the finished product.
